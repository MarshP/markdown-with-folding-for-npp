## Markdown Syntax for Notepad++ with Folding ##

<small>I originally downloaded the basis of this from someone else's GitHub repo, but that was before I knew how to clone, or fork, or use Git. Apologies to whomever that was.</small>

This is a np++ UDL (xml) file for Markdown syntax, with the addition of section-folding (I use markdown for my daily to-do, and it got long). 

To fold use

{f}

...folded text...

{/f}

or use

\<f\>

...folded text...

\</f\>

each tag alone at the start of a line.

To install:

1. Save the xml file locally.
2. In np++ select: (menu) - Language - Define your language - Import.
