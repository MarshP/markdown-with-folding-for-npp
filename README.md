## Markdown Syntax for Notepad++ with Folding ##

I originally downloaded the basis of this from someone else's GitHub repo, but that was before I knew how to clone, or fork, or use Git. Apologies to whomever that was.

This is a np++ UDL (xml) file for Markdown syntax, with the addition of section-folding (I use markdown for my daily to-do, and it got long). 

To fold use

{f}
{/f}

or use

<f>
</f>

To install:

1. Save the xml file locally.
2. In np++ select: (menu) - Language - Define your language - Import.
